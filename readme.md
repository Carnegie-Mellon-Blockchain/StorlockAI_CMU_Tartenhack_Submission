## Introduction

**dAIp: AI-enhanced Dapp Creation, Unlocking Web3's Full Potential**

dAIp is a website builder for creating composable, IP-protected Dapps, empowering builders' monetization through AI and royalties.

Creating fully functioning Dapps is costly and complex, limiting adoption despite growing blockchain infrastructure. dAIp aims to solve this by leveraging AI to simplify the Dapp creation process, reducing technical barriers and costs. Our platform empowers teams of all sizes to customize Dapp templates effortlessly, fostering more real-world Web3 use cases. dAIp also addresses the IP of AI-generated creations, incorporating royalty systems, group collaboration, and a dispute resolution module, ensuring creators' rights and fair distribution of rewards.

## Features

Key Functions of dAIp:

**AI-Driven Template Modification**: Users can easily modify existing templates by communicating their desired changes to the AI, which will generate updated Dapp designs in real time.

**IP Protection via NFTs**: Once a user customizes a template, it can be registered as an NFT, serving as a verifiable record of intellectual property ownership.

**IP Dispute Resolution**: A decentralized system to handle any IP disputes within the ecosystem, ensuring fairness and protection of creator rights.

**Royalty Distribution**: dAIp enables creators to embed royalty mechanisms directly into their templates, allowing them to earn from future use and iterations of their work.

**Grouping of Templates**: Multiple templates can be grouped together to create complex Dapps, enabling seamless collaboration across different functionalities.

## Bounty Writeup

### Phala-Network

Code: 

dAIp's backend is powered by Phala Network, leveraging its Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for secure and confidential computation.
```bash
cd backend
docker-compose up 
```

### Near Protocol

User owned AI is Near
Bring AI and Web3 together to enable a user-owned internet that guarantees privacy and ownership of data and assets, where everyone can be a builder. Some ideas to explore:
* Build autonomous agents and explore their on-chain interaction on Near

Takeaway:
We find a bug while functionCall()

```bash
Scheduling a call: daip.prelaunch.testnet.new()

Debug contract compilation: set rustup to 1.77, higher version maybe cause deseralization error.

### Walrus

dAIp leverages Walrus to securely upload and store files on its decentralized network, linking them to SUI objects. This empowers users to interact with SUI objects for future transactions, dApps customization, and asset representation in a seamless, verifiable manner, ultimately catalyzing innovative solutions in the community.

### Dynamic Wallet

We use Dynamic (Production Environment) to onboard more users from Web2 to our platform. 
To support the Story Protocol Iliad testnet, we've added Network Configuration to Dynamic. 
This helps us with monetization from customer and enhances the user interaction experience.

Code: frontend/src/components/DynamicModel/WalletWidget.tsx#7

### Unlimit 

In Daip code block cases, we use Unlimit for user onramp with host module in sandbox env.

Schema Url: https://onramp-sandbox.gatefi.com/?merchantId={merchantId}&cryptoCurrency=eth&cryptoAmount={NFT_FEE}&cryptoAmountLock=True&cryptoCurrencyLock=True&fiatCurrency=USD&fiatCurrencyLock=True&wallet={AGENT_ADDRESS}
Unlimit web hook: https://daip.buidler.house/core/webhook/
We want users to pay with USD to mint NFT, when we receive the onramp.sucess event, we mint NFT to user by the agent wallet after blocks confirmation.
